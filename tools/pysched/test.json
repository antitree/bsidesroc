This is because most defensive strategies have focused on stopping attacks at their initial vector. In this talk, I will go over how I attack and bypass most deflection controls and go under the detection radar. I will then highlight the areas where defenders can begin to build a detection defense which will identify attacker behavior regardless of the initial vector. I will run through attacks I have used, which bypass several deflective controls, and show you how you can create detection controls to detect me; that is, if you can.", "type": "", "description": "Detect Me If You Can"}, {"title": "Over the past year, we've witnessed a shift in malware used by both the common criminal, and targeted actor alike.

We'll talk about how and why this transition has occurred, as well as a number of interesting case studies about how this malware winds up on a victim's machine.

Consider this, the great majority of organizations can't answer these basic questions. 'Are we safe from the latest attack that's all over the news? Can we prove that our security controls are working as intended? Do we know if a configuration change negatively impacted our security effectiveness? Who can provide us with empiric evidence about the value we are getting from security?'

While I attempted to convert to using Binary Ninja, I often missed the fusion of static and dynamic analyses that IDA provided, and existing Binary Ninja debugger integrations were not designed with Windows users in mind.
