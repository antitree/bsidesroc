If you’ve been to more than one BSidesROC before, you may have noticed the difference in venues over the years. Starting last year, BSidesROC  has been lucky to partner with RIT’s CSEC department and have them host us on their campus in the GCCIS building. CSEC is on the front line of security and continues to be one of the top colleges in the nation for infosec.
