#### CFP Guideline

We are looking for a variety of topics to be presented at this year’s con. Additionally, this year, we are seeking a mix of shorter, simple talks and longer, more detailed talks.  We’re targeting 20 and 50 minutes respectively.

We are generally looking for any kind of security/hacking related talks. But specifically to match our theme, we’d love to see presentations regarding:

- Cryptography
- Secure Communications
- Secure Desktops/OS
- Privacy
- Anonymity/Pseudonymity
- Embedded Systems or IoT
- Mobile (OS, application, baseband, etc.)
- Application Security
- Network Penetration Testing
- DFIR
- Hacker Community and infosec industry perspectives
- Tool release

Our team will review any talk submission but our only rule is that we will not accept a talk about a service or product you or your employer is selling. Please make all talks technical in nature.

#### Who Is The Audience?

When considering a submission for BSidesROC, it may be helpful to consider who our attendees have been in the past. Check out our [/about](/about) page that gives you some details about our
demographics. We have a mix of students and professionals but in general, management/sales slides
do not go over well in this crowd.
