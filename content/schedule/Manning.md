description= "Monolithic applications are a thing of the past but our job as security professionals is to review them from a security perspective. This talk will review container technologies (e.g. Docker, LXC) as well as container orchestration technologies (e.g. Kubernetes, Marathon). We will cover new container-centric OS&#x27;s like CoreOS and what security implications exist for each. What is their threat model? What does a &quot;pen test&quot; against these technologies really mean? We&#x27;ll include real-world exploit scenarios we&#x27;ve seen in client environments. "
