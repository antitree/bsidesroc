description= "The security of IoT devices has been a trending topic ever since the term itself was first coined. The correlation between IoT and cyber insecurity intensified after a number of major incidents that specifically targeted these devices.  This talk covers a penetration test that we performed on a number of surveillance cameras which we randomly purchased on amazon. We will cover the entire process from the moment the product was received, to developing exploitation scripts."
