## BSidesROC – The Organization

Security BSidesROC is run by volunteers; people that feel the need to help create a hacker conference in Rochester so strongly that they give up weekends and free time to make it happen.

We help divide up the workload by making “Op” positions for the various facets of the conference. Ops are in charge of keeping track of their project’s money, managing the volunteers that help them, and coming up with awesome ways to get things done.

**Bill "JustBill" Bukowski (Director)**

JustBill brings expert level knowledge in the latest enterprise technology to the group. He is a “Manager” of IT for the largest market research company in the world. He no longer needs to actually know things but make sure you have your management slide ready for him just in case he cares. He has a background in Ham radio, and enjoys hacking all things RF related. He denies that he is a hacker, but if you talk to him for more than a minute you’ll see he’s wrong or just confused.

**Joe Testa (Director)**

Mr. Testa is a man of many names – friends call him Cowboy Joe, or the SeCowboi. Joe has been an infosec professional for much of his career. He started out as a developer of Rapid 7’s Nexpose vulnerability scanner, where he quickly learned the ins-and-outs of network exploitation. Since then, Joe has since gone out on to own to operate his own Rochester-based security company, [Positron Security](http://www.positronsecurity.com/).
