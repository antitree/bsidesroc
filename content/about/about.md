## What is BSidesROC?

Security B-Sides Rochester, or BSidesROC, is an open, non-profit hacker conference in Rochester, NY. It provides a place for people to learn about hacking, infosec, and all kinds of different technology in a fun environment.

Our seventh year was another action packed event that included presentations from industry professionals, games and challenges that exercised your hacker skills, as well as community involvement that represents the Rochester community. We helped students and employers match up to see if we can’t turn the amateur hacker into a career plan.

Here’s a quick summary of our conference based on surveys from attendees:
