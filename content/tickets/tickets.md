## Free conference tickets for resume submissions

Are you looking for a job?  In that case, you can get a *free ticket* (to the con only) by reserving an "Entry (Resume Program)" ticket type, then submitting a resume by April 9th to *resumes at-sign bsidesroc d0tt c0mm*.  Resumes will be distributed to all Gold-level sponsors, and several of them are actively recruiting!

Submit your resume soon, as free tickets are limited.

## T-Shirt Design

We are also selling t-shirts along with conference tickets. The design is still being finalized, but because demand is so high, we are offering them ahead of time.  Optionally, you can keep an eye on our [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/bsidesroc) for an announcement on the finished design.
