# FAQs 

## What are my parking options?

You will need to get a parking pass from the Welcome Center.  You can then park in Lot J in front of the B. Thomas Golisano College of Computing.  No parking pass will be necessary for the event on Saturday.

## Will classes sell out?

Most likely. We've selected these classes because of how popular they will be and the low cost so they are likely to sell out early. Mark your calendars. 

## What is your refund policy?

You can get a full refund if you give us notification within 8 days. 

## I have a specific question, who do I email?

If you have a question about which tickets to buy, email info at bsidesroc.com.
