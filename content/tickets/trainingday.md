Wi-Fi Hacking (morning)
Trainer: Mark El-Khoury, NCC Group

Description: Attendees will start by exploring the absolute basics of Wi-Fi (What are control frames, management frames, etc.?) and will leave the training room armed with all the knowledge they will ever need to identify the wireless attack surface and conduct a Wi-Fi security assessment. The training will cover WEP, WPA2-Personal, WPA2-Enterprise, WPS, the most recent developments in Wi-Fi such as KRACK, and will include hands-on labs. The training will also cover direct attacks against wireless clients and access points, such as router and firmware vulnerabilities, rogue access points, and denial-of-service attacks.

Time: 8:00am to 12:00pm 

Requirements: Bring: 1) a machine with Kali Linux installed (can be a VM) and 2) a packet-injection capable wireless card, such as the Alfa AWUS036h.  Attendees are also encouraged to bring any Wi-Fi-related equipment that they would like to show off!  No prior knowledge is needed, but ideally you should be familiar with setting up your wireless card in monitor mode to minimize setup time during the workshop.

Price: $10



SOS (Save Our Splunk!) (afternoon)
Trainer: Tom Kopchak, Hurricane Labs

Description: 

Are you drowning in log files? Have you heard of Splunk, but don't know what it does or why you should care? Have you used Splunk, but want to learn how to get it set up or do more with it? If so, this class is for you. Learn how to navigate Splunk and dominate big data.

In this free class, Tom will teach you how to get started with Splunk. You'll learn the basics of Splunk terminology, and how to use the Splunk web interface to find the data you're looking for. You'll also learn some more advanced searching techniques that are helpful for those in network, security, and system administration roles. Finally, you'll build your own Splunk environment, add data, and learn how to create dashboards and find events in your data.

Time: 1:00pm to 5:00pm 

Requirements: Laptop with web browser and SSH client.  Familiarity with Linux command line is a plus.  Attendees are also encouraged to bring log files to use as data sources as part of the class so that you will be working with data that is meaningful to you. Sample log files will be provided as well.

### What are my parking options?

You will need to get a parking pass from the Welcome Center.  You can then park in Lot J in front of the B. Thomas Golisano College of Computing.  No parking pass will be necessary for the event on Saturday.
