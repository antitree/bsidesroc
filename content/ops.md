## 0. Abstract
The BSidesROC organization structure mirrors an IRC network with channels that are events and 
ops that organize the events. Above this control structure is a meta organization that maintains
the Business as outlined in the Bylaws. Directors historically have the most responsibility and 
end up making a lot of the decisions for the organization. Ops are the sole owners of their events
and, in most cases, override any opinions of the directors when it comes to the event that they Op.

### Bylaws
See [Bylaws](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O3WdOIBZkW2LS4vU25udph1amSMv9_QLQBbpmYysfRc/edit)

### Directors
As described in the [Bylaws](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O3WdOIBZkW2LS4vU25udph1amSMv9_QLQBbpmYysfRc/edit),
Directors have specific responsibilities to the corporation as well as making sure the event is successful.
They're responsible for tying together all the other events and ops into a coherent conference. 
They are also the figureheads for the organization in an honorary capacity 
(or when news organizations need an interview). 

### Operators (Ops)
Operators or "Ops" are an attempt to give full authority to volunteers that want to contribute to the conference. 
As an op, you have all the responsibility and all of the praise for your event. 
You override the authority of the directors or other volunteers (unless there are safety concerns)

For example, the CTF Op will be responsible for building and running the CTF. 
If they can't do this alone, they can either Co-Op with others, or find 
volunteers that can contribute. It's their responsibility to make sure everything 
goes smoothly, *whatever it takes*.

### Volunteers
A volunteer is a crucial roll to making a smooth event. They are similar to DEFCON goons. 
A volunteer will work on shifts during or before the event but are not necessarily 
involved in it's planning. Ops can be volunteers and volunteers can become ops after
being a volunteer for a year. 

### VIPs
Speakers, Trainers, Friends, family, etc. that support  us through the event are 
considered VIPs. They can be invited to parties and get swag and free entry into
the conference if desired. 

## 2. History 
BSidesROC was founded in TKTK as a reaction to the industry of "hacker" "conferences"
that were taking over a community with enterprise sales departments. The result
was an inclusive conference designed to share technical knowledge, help advance
careers, and support a community of hackers and professionals alike. 

2011: The first conference held at the historic Auditorium Center and masonic temple
on Main St. Rochester.  This was selected by asking a bartender at Lux Lounge and 
would be the home for the con for the next few years. The first year yielded (less than?) a 100 attendees but
served as the foundation for each subsequent year. Pizza was served but without knowing
how much to order, more than 20 sheet pizzas were thrown away or giving to passing
homeless people. 

2012: Another year at the Auditorium Center now with more AV equipment and expanding
into the "Convent" or Tea Room at the front of the building. The networking and power requirements
take at least a day to setup and the main space is used for the hangout and CTF. It
keep the hacker feel with black table covers on every table. There was no keynote. 

[2013](/archive/2013): The last year at the Auditorium Center got rid of Capture the Pile and replaced
it with Hacker Battleship. During the conference, hacker battleship scoreboard was completely
owned and needed to be cancelled. Two tracks ran and many of the presenters were organizers
or friends of organizers. This was the first and last time we 3D printed 189 badges
thanks to Interlock Rochester. 

[2014](/archive/2014): The first year at the german house. This was also the first year of food trucks
which were a success and an addition to future years. The keynote was David Kennedy. This marks
the first year of expanding the various events during the conference to include key signing
a privacy workshop, a beer networking event, and other secret events during the con. 

[2015](/archive/2015): The German House was again the home for BSidesROC but it was under new ownership.
This was the first attempt at having training during the conference while the con was
going on with Tor and SDR classes happening. The tracks were re-arranged this year with
a track in the restaurant and a track in the basement. This was also the year that
the owners of the German House screwed the organization costing them thousands and the
last time anyone went there. 

[2016](/archive/2016): The first year at RIT and when the attendee numbers jumped again. The conference
increased the number of students making up almost 50% of the attendees. This was
the first year of the failed Resumelee program. This was also the year the CTF raised
the bar with prizes for the winners and more complex and difficult challenges. The
keynote was the EFF lawyer Nate Cardozo. Also to note, we had competiting sponsors
of energy drinks -- Club Mate and Bawls.  

[2017](/archive/2017): Again at RIT's GCCIS building, the conference went with a Russian Propaganda
themed posters as this was fun as topical at the time. 3 tracks and more than 400
attendees filled up the conference. Int80 from Dual Core was the keynote. The 
conference has a more formal feel while trying to keep its original roots as a 
grungy hacker con.

#### Media Announcements
Our social media consists of a bunch of announcements in various platforms. The current setup is explained below:

*Buffer*: let's us schedule updates on various platforms including:

* Facebook
* LinkedIn
* Twitter
* Google Plus

*Mail chimp*: an announcement newsletter is used to send important updates. This should mirror other announcements but be slower. It is our most engaging method.

#### Tickets
We manage tickets for training day, the conference, and the after party, with EventBrite.  Tickets have been $10 lately with discounts to certain groups like sponsors.

### Events/Op Positions
The following have been events BSidesROC has organized.

#### Art
Art covers TShirts and the propaganda posters.

*T-shirts*: every year we reach out to local artists to hire then to build a design for the t-shirts and maybe the website.

*Posters*: posters have evolved from a functional directional sign to signs with sponsor logos on it to propaganda style posters. This too has been outsourced to a local artist.

#### CTF
Our CTF used to be a battleship style board but now it is just a Jeopardy board of various challenge categories. The CTF op os on charge of making the challenges work, verifying that they work during the event, and support it so everything runs during the event. The CTF also had prizes to give away. Finding those prizes is the ops responsibility. All details are subject to change per the CTF op.

#### Resume Program
The resume program exchanges resumes for tickets. If you give us a resume, we will let you in free and provide it to one of our sponsors who are hiring.

#### Key Signing
In recent years we have organized a key signing party for GPG/PGP keys. In the past the op has been a community person and the event runs for 30-60 minutes during the day.

#### Swag bag
This is a bag of stuff that everyone gets when they attend. Historically coupons, ads, objects, are fairly common.

#### Lightning talks
Or lightning talks are 10-15 minutes long. They are usually put together in a block at the end of the day off the con. In recent years we have format scheduled presenters and have them a time slot of it was at least 20 minutes long.

#### Crypto challenge
The Crypto Challenge is designed by DarthNull. No one knows what's it's going to be about until a week before. The only way to play is to show up to the con.

#### Keynote
The keynote is generally by someone that the organizers believe has something interesting to say to the BSidesROC attendees. In the past this has  been Rel1k, int80, lawyer from the EFF. 

#### Community Room
The idea for the community room is to share community projects with BSidesROC attendees. This has been TOOOL, interlock, GDI, Ada Space, and more. They have their own room and a table to work from.
