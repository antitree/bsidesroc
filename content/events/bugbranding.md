Announcing the BSidesROC Bug Branding Competition

As we all know, the hardest part of crafting an 0-day is designing a clever name and logo. Here at BSidesROC, we want to help you get ahead on this aspect of exploit development. So, by 3pm on April 14th 2018, send us your branding ideas for any bug, real or imaginary. You may use old CVEs, current research, or your own psychosis for inspiration. Some of our favorite submissions will be presented during the closing ceremony, with a prize for the “best”.

All bug brand submissions must include a name, description, and logo. The description should be a few sentences about the vuln, e.g. how it works, what software/hardware/physiology it targets, implications, and possible solutions. Again, it must have a logo. This isn’t 2013.

Submit your bug using this Google Form: [Bug Branding Competition Submission](https://goo.gl/forms/CHTKwtCSuCLJBe5u1)
