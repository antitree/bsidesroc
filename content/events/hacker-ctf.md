[THE COMPETITION BEGINS ON APRIL 22 AT 9:00AM](https://ctf.bsidesroc.com)

Did we say capture-the-flag? We lied.

This year, we are going to do a hacker challenge in the form of a
Jeopardy-style scoreboard. Don't think that this is some lame trivia-type game,
though. Contestants will be challenged with cryptography, reverse engineering,
and penetration testing puzzles of increasing difficulty. Hours of fun!!

Just like in the classic Jeopardy game, harder challenges grant more points.
Each team (**of up to 4 people**) gets their own scoreboard instance, so challenges
solved by other teams remain available. Whichever team scores the most points
by the end of the conference wins a brand new 2017 Toyota RAV4*!

Participants should come prepared with a laptop, and optionally with Kali Linux
on a USB drive.

*\*This is another alternative fact. Also, we've always been at war with
Eurasia...*
