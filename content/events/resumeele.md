Résumélee is a challenge to get your résumé into the hands of people that want to hire you... but with a twist. Each résumé should be delivered in whatever way you feel like it -- the geekier the better. Just like last year, you will get a free ticket to the conference if you enter your résumé into the competition.

## Rules:

We take our résumélee event seriously but it's also a lot of fun. If you want to get involved, here's the rules

1. You must have signed up prior to the event to take part by reserving a [Résumélee Participant ticket](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bsides-rochester-2017-tickets-31953825753)
2. First drafts of résumés submitted as PDF or text file must be submitted by 3/22
4. A final draft of your résumé must be provided to us by 4/21
5. You must show up in person to present your crazy résumé

## What do you get out of it?

We want to get you hired at job that you enjoy or if we can't do that directly, at least help you get your résumé ready to submit. We will:

* Give you a free ticket into the conference
* Supply a group of reviewers to go through your résumé and provide you feedback on what you might want to change
* Provide copies of these résumés directly to our sponsors who are looking to hire you
* Give out prizes for best résumé as determined by our judges

## How should I deliver a résumé?

You must give us 2 copies: one in the normal PDF or text format and the other in whatever delivery method you choose -- that's up to you. Here are some ideas to spark your creativity:

* Is there a more interesting medium besides paper to deliver your résumé on? 
* Do you have a particular skill that you could show off in your delivery?
* Electronic and physical submissions are welcome.

Submit drafts and final copies to **resumelee@bsidesroc.com**. 

## How do I sign up?
If there are any tickets left, you can sign up for a [Résumélee Ticket](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bsides-rochester-2017-tickets-31953825753) on our ticket page. If there are no tickets left, you can email info at bsidesroc.com to let us know you want to be part of Résumélee and we will direct you what the next steps are.
