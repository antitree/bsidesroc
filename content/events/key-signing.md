Join us for another installment of the BSidesROC Key-Signing Party.
We will again facilitate a room that lets people join in and 
sign other people's OpenPGP keys. 

## How to get involved
* If you haven't already, generate an OpenPGP key
* Print out, or write down the long version of your key's fingerprint `gpg --keyid-format LONG -k 0xDEADBEEF`
* Bring an ID or proof that you own the key
* Show up at 1pm at the designated room
* Take the other person's public key
* Go home and sign their key
* Send them a copy of the key back to them
* Receive a copy of your key signed by another person
* Upload it to one of the key servers
