Our community room is a place for people in the community to share with BSidesROC attendees. This
is a chance to meet some of the people in the community and see if they have something that interests you. 

## [TOOOL Rochester](https://tooolroc.org/): 
TOOOL will be running a lock pick village the whole day to teach people about physical security.

## [Infragard](https://www.infragard.org/): 
Visit Infragard if you want to hear about the local Rochester chapter.

## [Interlock Rochester](https://www.interlockroc.org): 
Interlock will be there to discuss the local hackerspace and what it's used for.
