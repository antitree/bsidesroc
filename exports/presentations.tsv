12/4/2017 19:48:41	rs4983@rit.edu	Ryan Sidebottom	Presentation	Social Media: 'Saving' Your Life	Have you ever wondered what information social media sites like Google, Facebook, Tinder, Twitter and Snapchat collect on you? In short, they collect everything. If you have ever been curious about what these platforms collect, here’s your opportunity to learn. Prefacing the data will be an overview of the Terms of Service and Privacy. Inside the policies, most companies declare what information they take and what their intentions are to do with the data. After discussing the policies and terms, I’ll go through both what is stored locally on the mobile device along with the data collected and stored on their servers. Sorry, I won’t be giving you my phone number that easily. Some of the data is surprising, and some of it is obvious. All of it is concerning.	Ryan is a fourth-year student at the Rochester Institute of Technology who is in the final stretch of his degree. In security, his interests are in vulnerability assessment and penetration testing. Outside of security, he enjoys looking at cars and playing disc golf. There are no problems with going fast and taking chances.	No. Or at least not yet.	This presentation is going to be an extremely laid-back talk with the intention of engaging the audience in conversation. The goal of the presentation is to educate everyone on what information social media collects, how they collect it, how you can prevent it, and what they do with that information. In the talk, I will discuss everything from the Terms of Service and Privacy Policies to my data that I requested from these sites. The sites I will be analyzing are Facebook, Tinder, Google, Snapchat and Twitter. Prior to discussing my data, I will go through the policies to examine what the sites say they collect and then compare it to what the sites collected from me. I have made shorter, more specific presentations for the RIT student club SPARSA (here is my presentation on the data from Facebook, https://youtu.be/vk_I3zz7cx0?t=13m, 13:00 to about 36:00). In this presentation, I went into detail as to what Facebook collects as it was the only site I was analyzing. Since I will be talking about all five sites, my time will be appropriated differently. In addition to the data collected and stored remotely, there will also be analysis on the data collected and stored locally by each app. On top of this, I will try and see if there is a way to see what data is being sent to third party sites and other domains while you are using the app. Like all good presentations, it will end with a lovely Q&A.

Tired of your everyday, boring, linear table top exercises? Do you feel your scenarios lack creativity? Are they missing real-world rewards and consequences? Come hear our approach on how we follow industry best practice with a choose your own adventure style twist. We will cover the people involved, our scenario creation process, and technologies that were used.   Following industry best practice (MITRE Cyber Exercise Playbook and NIST 800-84) the Information Security team created a scenario with a choose your own adventure style twist. The decisions made during the exercise dictated if a real-world reward or consequence was given. These decisions had an active impact on the remainder of the exercise. The scenario focused on situations that have happened in past incidents as well as incidents that have occurred within the past few quarters within the larger Information Industry.   The Information Security team had the clear goal of establishing a baseline for future exercises and raising Incident Response awareness within the larger organization. Clear objectives were put in place to facilitate the measurement against expected outcomes. Lastly, we will share lessons learned as well as our ideas for out next table top exercise.

This is because most defensive strategies have focused on stopping attacks at their initial vector. In this talk, I will go over how I attack and bypass most deflection controls and go under the detection radar. I will then highlight the areas where defenders can begin to build a detection defense which will identify attacker behavior regardless of the initial vector. I will run through attacks I have used, which bypass several deflective controls, and show you how you can create detection controls to detect me; that is, if you can.

1/19/2018 18:42:07	jgrunzweig@paloaltonetworks.com	Josh Grunzweig	Presentation	Rise of the Miners	Over the past year, we've witnessed a shift in malware used by both the common criminal, and targeted actor alike. While ransomware was the bell of the ball in the past, it has been replaced with the up and coming cryptocurrency miner. This talk will explore the trends witnessed in the past year as they pertain to the rise in popularity of cryptocurrency miners being used and deployed by criminals. We'll talk about how and why this transition has occurred, as well as a number of interesting case studies about how this malware winds up on a victim's machine. Finally, we'll also discuss the most popular cryptocurrencies being mined today, and strategies you can take to mitigate this threat. 	Josh Grunzweig is a Principal Malware Researcher with Unit 42, the threat intelligence team within Palo Alto Networks. His specialties include reverse-engineering various malware families, dabbling in Python scripting, and he has even been known to thwart ransomware and find vulnerabilities in malware panels from time to time. He has historically focused on financially-motivated malware, such as point of sale malware, ransomware, and banking Trojans, however, these days he pretty much looks at most malware-based threats. His previous work has included various areas within the information technology industry, including penetration testing, network administration, and systems administration. He graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology with a BS in Applied Networking and Systems Administration.	Nope. Live about 20 minutes away, and since presentations are on a Saturday, it shouldn't be a problem. 	This is a new talk I'm putting together. It marries together research from external companies, Palo Alto Networks (PAN) research that I myself have not specifically worked on, as well as a wealth of research I've personally performed. At PAN, we've got a fair amount of visibilities into threats, and process something like 4 million unique samples a day in our cloud-based sandbox. This talk will discuss overall trends about how miners are gaining additional momentum in recent months. After talking about big picture stuff, I'll drill down into various case studies. Some things that are PAN-specific include trends witnessed in the RIG exploit kit and discussion of javascript-based miners (Coinhive), Some things I've personally looked at recently include miners distributed via malware hosted on adfly that affected a confirmed 15 million victims (actual numbers are probably closer to 30-45 million), as well as miners pushed out via a Russian-based bittorrent site. I may also touch on some recent research that discusses a North Korea APT that was found mining on a recent campaign. There's also been some activity involving large botnets changing tactics and performing mining instead of their normal DDoS stuff. Plus there has been some recent research that involves traditional web-based exploits that ultimately delivery mining. There's a lot of material that I can draw on, and I can really dig in deep if necessary. I'll pick and choose some of the best stuff to drill down into, and probably gloss over some of the less interesting stuff. It'll just come down to how much content I can fit in in the 50 minute slot. I might also do some additional research to see what the breakdown of currencies being mined is across our entire dataset. I'll wrap up with the usual conclusion, and talk about protections.   I'm submitting this same talk to ISOI and Thotcon, but BSidesROC is the earliest conference of the three, so you guys would get the first crack at it. 		No	50 Minute		APPROVED	Track 2	1300	yes
1/26/2018 11:33:13	duncan@sfractal.com	Duncan Sparrell	Presentation	Cybersecurity Needs to Go Paleo	My wife eats Paleo - I make fun of her caveman diet. She’s lost 40 pounds and is very fit - I am overweight. This talk will examine the similarities between paleo and cybersecurity as well as throw some rocks (caveman weapon of choice) at some of our cherished myths in cybersecurity. The good news is “getting back to basics” is easier with today’s technologies like cloud. I will explain some of the scientific basis of paleo and show how it relates to analogs in cybersecurity as well as how it applies to you.                                                             This talk will not contain any new startling revelations (maybe one – paleo bacon. Who knew bacon was full of sugar?). The talk will be a different way to look at cybersecurity and hopefully give you some new insights. It will point to some existing open source code and introduce some new “glue” code specifically to demonstrate the principles being touted.	Duncan Sparrell is a seasoned (aka old) software developer and network security evangelist. He started when computers were the size of buildings and programmed with punch cards. After 35 years with AT&T, he semi-retired 4 years ago and gives back to the community while pursuing his interests in cloud security, agile, open source, and erlang. While most of his cyber experience has been blue team, he started his cyber career as part of an AFIWC cyber attack team during the first Gulf War. Besides various certs (CSSIP, CSSLP, CCSK, PE), he was awarded the Intelligence Community Seal Medallion, and the AT&T Science and Technology Medal.	I am flying to CA for BSidesSF and RSA on a Saturday evening flight (5:30 takeoff) so would like to leave by 3:30 latest	The talk will begin just like the abstract, humorously explaining how I came to recognize the similarities between the paleo diet of my wife and my attempt to get people to recognize the fundamentals of cybersecurity.                                                    The paleo diet is based on the foods humans consumed back when they were hunter/gatherers in the Paleolithic era (~2.6 million years ago until ~10,000 years ago). It’s based on the premise that our genetics and digestive systems are more tuned to that diet than todays. Like many of us in cybersecurity, the practitioners of the paleo diet can be passionate (aka fanatical) in their beliefs and there are other analogies as well.   The paleo diet includes organically-raised vegetables, fruits, nuts, roots, and meat while excluding foods such as dairy products, grains, sugar, legumes, processed oils, artificial sweeteners, and processed sugar. I take each of these and draw analogies to cybersecurity principles.   Avoiding processed sugar (particularly corn syrup) is one of the tenants of the paleo diet. After humorously depicting this, I will draw the analogy of sweeteners to FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) in cybersecurity. In both cases, we have way too much. Just like paleo practitioners need to moderate sugar and substitute using honey and maple syrup, we need to cut down on FUD and substitute cyber risk economics. I will briefly explain loss-exceedance curves and some of the work of Hubbard/Seiersen in having a more objective scale for cybersecurity risk using probability of monetary loss. And paleo (sugarless) bacon both tastes better and makes cleaner fat - anything cooked in paleo bacon fat tastes better! Similarly, loss-exceedance curves will help us make better cyberspend decisions.   Paleo portion control is less about volume and more about the ratio of protein/fat/carbs and the quality of the food leading to less-food-being-more-filling. The security analog is ‘less is more’. I’ll show how ‘bigger is better’ is now a skeuomorph when it comes to cloud design, and show how recognizing this will help security.   Paleo encourages the use of organically grown food and I’ll show how this relates to avoiding complexity and the single responsibility principle. Paleo also encourages knowing where your food comes from and being a locavore (ie nearer is better). This is analogous to the clean source principle - all security dependencies need to be as trustworthy as the object being secured.   Paleo eschews dairy and grains. But amazingly you can make paleo ice cream and paleo pizza using substitutes. These facts will be tied to demo code described at the end of the talk.   No talk on paleo is complete without the alcohol debate. I’ll show the evidence (citing a Scientific American article) on why ‘enlightened’ paleo is the correct view (ie yes we can drink!) and how this relates to cybersecurity.		No	20 Minute		DENIED

Unsurprisingly, hackers have been weaponizing cryptocurrency mining software, which the hackers install onto a victim’s computer without the victim’s knowledge. Once installed, this malware uses the victim’s own computing resources to “mine” cryptocurrency. In this presentation, we will cover the cryptojacking threat starting with the underlying technology, blockchain. From here, we will digress into what a coinminer is and my first introduction to a fresh sample along with tactics used to "hunt" down miners for analysis using publicly available data. Then, we will go into detail about different operations found during research with specific examples of attacks and exploits, followed by distribution. This will include different types of coinminers as well from those which run on a computer to those which rely on open web browser sessions.  Last, we will cover key takeaways and how to combat the coinminer threat!	Terrance DeJesus is Threat Research Analyst at NTT Security.

Unsurprisingly, hackers have been weaponizing cryptocurrency mining software, which the hackers install onto a victim’s computer without the victim’s knowledge. Once installed, this malware uses the victim’s own computing resources to “mine” cryptocurrency.   Although coinminers are not technically new, they have been appearing more often in the analysis and research conducted by the threat intel community. Simple and more advanced variants have been discovered, which include, but are not limited to, evasive techniques to avoid anti-virus detection and massive distribution tactics like WannaCry ransomware. Instead of Bitcoin, Monero (XMR) is the preferred cryptocurrency mined by threat actors. Preference stems from the increased security and anonymity XMR provides, which includes prevention of fund tracking, encrypted user addresses, convoluted tracking of transactions and more.  Regardless, this new "trend" has even been focused on by advanced persistent threats (APT) such as HIDDEN COBRA, aka the Lazarus Group for additional funding in their operations. Who can blame them, as some small operations, such as Smominru, have net hackers millions of dollars.  Over the last several months, I have been analyzing several dozen different mining operations, discovering simple opportunistic approaches and those which are more advanced. Research has lead me to discovering the trends used by hackers using coinminers, their distribution preferences, how anonymity is a high priority, and the various platforms targeted.  Coinmining is simple and can be packaged into a variety of different types for different systems. With minimal effort, an attacker, with monetary motivation, could easily make money as soon as the coinminer starts. In the future, this will become the norm for various attacks and operations where the main object might not even be to setup a coinminer, but if it is setup successfully, why not? As such, this has pros and cons, a pro being we can hunt for common miner artifacts, which may lead to more nefarious and evasive activity at hand. Already, coinminers have been leveraged by actors distributing ransomware in which both are installed on a victim machine as hopefully one or the other will make a profit for the actor.

While Burp Suite is a very useful tool, using it to perform authorization testing is often a tedious effort involving a "change request and resend" loop, which can miss vulnerabilities and slow down testing. AutoRepeater, an open source Burp Suite extension, was developed to alleviate this effort. AutoRepeater automates and streamlines web application authorization testing, and provides security researchers with an easy-to-use tool for automatically duplicating, modifying, and resending requests within Burp Suite while quickly evaluating the differences in responses.  	Justin Moore works for NCC Group as a Senior Security Consultant. He hacks things and does stuff, sometimes it’s the other way around.  	Nope	Burp Suite is an intercepting HTTP Proxy which is the defacto tool for performing web application security testing. While Burp Suite is a very useful tool, performing authorization testing using Burp Suite is often a tedious effort involving a "change request and resend" loop which can miss vulnerabilities and slow down testing. AutoRepeater is an open source Burp Suite extension developed to automate and streamline web application authorization testing. AutoRepeater provides security researchers with an easy to use tool for automatically duplicating, modifying, and resending requests within Burp Suite and quickly evaluating the differences in responses.  Burp Suite is an intercepting HTTP proxy that is the defacto tool for web application penetration testing. Basically anyone who has tried to find security problems has probably used Burp Suite or is at least somewhat familiar with it. I'll briefly walkthrough some of the features for folks unfamiliar with Burp Suite.  The basic web application testing flow with Burp Suite is as follows:  1. Users noodle around a web application until they find an interesting request.  2. The user sends the request to Burp Suite's "Repeater" tool. 3. The user modifies the request within "Repeater" and resends it to the server. 4. Repeat step 3 until you find a sweet vulnerability. 5. Start again from step 1 until you run out of testing time or you can retire from bug bounty earnings.  This testing flow works, and has resulted in countless vulnerabilities being found, however, it's particularly tedious for testing issues that could exist within nearly any request. For example, changing email addresses, account identifies, roles, URLs, and CSRF tokens can all lead to vulnerabilities. Currently, Burp Suite does not to quickly test for these types of vulnerabilities quickly within a web application.  There are some existing Burp Suite plugins (AuthMatrix, Authz, and Autorize) which exist to make authorization testing easier but each has issues that limits their usefulness. AuthMatrix and Authz require users to send specific requests to the plugins and set up rules for how the authorization testing is performed which introduces the risk of missing important requests and slows down testing. Autorize does not provide the users with the ability to perform general purpose text replacements, can only perform one header or cookie replacement at a time, and has a confusing user interface. AutoRepeater takes all the best ideas from these plugins, along with the Burp Suite's familiar user interface, and combines them to create the most streamlined authorization testing plugin.  AutoRepeater provides a general purpose solution for streamlining authorization testing within web applications. AutoRepeater provides the following features:  + Automatically Duplicate, Modify, and Resend Any Request + Conditional Replacements + Quick Header, Cookie, and Parameter Value Replacements + Split Request/Response Viewer + Original vs. Modified Request/Response Diff Viewer + Base Replacements For Values That Break Requests Like CSRF Tokens and Session Cookies + Renamable Tabs + Logging + Exporting + Toggled Activation + "Send To AutoRepeater" From Other Burp Suite Tools  During the presentation I'll walkthrough a thorough description of each of the above listed features with screenshots.

2/28/2018 1:08:47	chris@partridge.tech	Chris Partridge	Presentation	Turning Domain Data into Domain Intelligence	DNS is a locked system - you can’t model the domain space at scale unless you get an AXFR from every authoritative nameserver there is, but you might be able to get a good model going if you attempted to discover and resolve all FQDNs. So, we’ll do the latter! dnstrace is a volunteer-supported, free suite of software that harvests, analyzes, and visualizes the relationships between domains so we can finally turn “domain information” into “domain intelligence” for everyone. Ever wanted to generate better domain reputation so grandma doesn’t get sent to the 200th .ru domain registered today that serves Flash malware? Or wanted to evaluate patterns in cybercrime at a global scale using domain data? Through big data and careful analysis, we can push the security envelope until we’re ahead of the curve for the first time since Creeper.	Chris “tweedge” Partridge is a 3rd year student working on his Bachelor's in the Computing Security major at RIT, Black Hat 2017 alum, and BSidesROC regular. He’s extremely passionate about making sure he doesn’t have to take any more 11pm phone calls from his family about their computers being infected, and has been putting a disproportionate amount of time into making that happen. He believes that writing and enhancing security technologies coupled with better security education can change people from “easy targets” to “not worth it.” As the core author of dnstrace, he’s starting to bring those dreams to life, one caffeine-fueled music-blasting coding-session at a time.	Nope	dnstrace is a pet project of mine that came about from doing a project in Professor Bill Stackpole's Netsec & Forensics class that specified that one had to engineer software that helps people visualize things related to security. Knowing that Cisco, FireEye, CrowdStrike, and other major players have access to domain intelligence (but access to it is either not available or costs quite a pretty penny), I decided that I wanted to democratize access and generate my own domain intelligence. Once the project for class ended, I took it to the internet and asked for volunteers to run harvesters for me - approximately 40 nodes were spun up globally, and using rudimentary (read: poorly written during finals week) software I was getting over 700 data points per second at peak. I've been analyzing data, rewriting the engines that power dnstrace, and adding geographically distributed nodes since.  The talk will begin by explaining the holes in domain intelligence and basic examples of how domain data could tell us a lot (if we had that level of insight), but don't because - well - we lack that kind of insight. For every problem there is a potential solution, and that's where dnstrace comes in. I'll give a high level overview of what data is aggregated, how it's analyzed/linked/visualized, and some basic stats on the project. Then I'll dive into what it takes to generate global domain intelligence.  Prerequisites first - I'll take a quick delve into DNS to make sure everyone's on the same page. What records can we look up, what do they mean, what software is typically used. Architecture of DNS, root servers, authority. Just a quick refresher course for making sure people know what they need to for the actual project.  The project's starting point is of course "what do we look up?" and that's a harder question to answer than most would expect - DNS is locked down, remember? Can't just get a full directory of domain information - certainly not subdomains, sometimes not even domains for a given TLD. You can get zone files for most TLDs, use Rapid7's Project Sonar, do NSEC walks (and NSEC3 walks if you really want to try), check PTR records for assigned IP space, attempt AXFRs against nameservers, etc. There's really a lot of options here and I'll try to briefly cover the major points for a project at a scale such as this. I'll address the flaws with each and build a model of what we can reasonably get.  Then it comes down to "how do we look it up?" - again AXFR is an option (but with a low success rate), could try DNS ANY and ALL queries despite their obsolescence and lowering success rates, but in a lot of cases it comes down to prioritizing the records you care most about and looking them up separately. There are notes to be made here about other architectures for getting domain information and I'll be mentioning DNSDB's tap method, its perks, and its detriments. I'll show some raw data here as well.  Now the fun begins - "what do we have, how do we make it useful?" Parsing first. Then we get to start generating graphs from the raw data, linking together domains by shared IPs or other shared records. We can generate a domain map for a block of IPs. We can see how domain data changes over time, and track active cyber threats as their internet presence changes. I'll be showing a bunch of screenshots as well as doing live demos.  And the fun continues with "what do we know from this, how can this be used?" Anomalies, such as globally sinkholed domain stats will be presented, as well as other small findings. More unique data (which I'll discuss what is and is not generally unique) is more likely to be a match, but DNS data is circumstantial - it would get an investigation off to the right start but wouldn't put someone behind bars. Circumstantial is good enough for keeping grandmothers safe though, and some applications outside security research and forensics are things like probabilistic blacklists to put on a PiHole and set up for people who would benefit from proactive domain blocking instead of reactive.   Lastly, "how can this be improved?" will be addressed. Things like WHOIS, better information displays, integrated scanning/scraping, more reputation sources, distributed NSEC3 cracking, and much more will be addressed. There's good reason for a number of those to not be implemented yet, but the more data that is fed in the more meaningful information we can get back out. This system is known to be incomplete, and there's yet a long way to go. I'll also mention the constraints in capabilities here because it's a volunteer-based project. Shamelessly, I'll also make a call out for any potential volunteers to come up or send an email.  This talk covers a lot about DNS and intricacies as well as data sources for finding actionable intelligence - especially at scale. I think this talk would adapt better to a 50-minute talk, especially if live demos are involved, but would happily present a quicker version of this talk as a 20-minute presentation.

In that time, CRS has become the defacto standard for various WAFs and expanded capabilities to cover everything from basic UTF-7 XSS to Java Deserialization and everything in between. In this talk we’ll discuss how both traditional and modern web environments deploys CRS, the features of upcoming releases, and how to deal with common issues that may be encountered.	Chaim is the Security Lead at ZeroFOX, which provides comprehensive social media protection for enterprises. Outside of ZeroFOX he teaches for the computing security department at the Rochester Institute of Technology. His areas of interest include web security with a focus on defensive web technologies. Chaim contributes to several Open Source projects including ModSecurity and OWASP Core Rule Set, where he serves as the project leader. 	Yes i’d like to focus on a morning time.	There are a couple of aspects that commonly trip people up when first encountering both Web Application Firewalls (WAF) and WAF rules. We’ll go into details about how individuals deploy traditional ModSecurity on Apache and via Docker/AMI and some common CDN architecture that use ModSecurity compatible WAFs in the backend. In support of both of these use cases we’ll discuss the design differences present in the new ModSecurity v3 and how these can be used to improve compatibility and capabilities.  ModSecurity compatible WAFs do not typically ship with any rules to block malicious activities, instead other projects are designed to fill this void. The most common ruleset is the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS). As the project leader for OWASP CRS I have a unique insight into this OWASP flagship project. I will outline some of the common issues in deploying CRS including adding exceptions for rules and increasing performance. Additionally, we’ll talk about some of the new capabilities that are being added as part of OWASP CRS version 3.1 that is being released Spring 2018.		No	20 Minute		APPROVED	Track 3	900	yes
3/10/2018 16:53:13	davekukfa@gmail.com	Dave Kukfa	Presentation	BinDbg: Easy Windows Debugging for Binary Ninja	IDA Pro -- the "gold standard" of binary analysis tools -- is very good at what it does, but it comes with a hefty price tag that is usually only justifiable to professional reverse engineers. Several alternatives have begun to challenge the status quo of reversing tools, including Binary Ninja: a powerful, affordable static-analysis tool. While I attempted to convert to using Binary Ninja, I often missed the fusion of static and dynamic analyses that IDA provided, and existing Binary Ninja debugger integrations were not designed with Windows users in mind. So, I wrote a plugin that syncs WinDbg to Binary Ninja to combine Binary Ninja's static analysis features (such as the disassembly graph and the IL) with the power of dynamic analysis (such as virtual function table resolution and knowing the outcome of branch instructions).	Dave Kukfa is a hobbyist reverse engineer by night and a security engineer focusing on corporate security by day. He graduated with a B.S. in Computing Security from RIT in 2017 and currently lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. You can find him on Twitter @kukfa_ and on his blog at https://kukfa.co.	naw	- speaker intro (2min) - background (3min) -- IDA is nice, but it's expensive -- other more affordable tools are challenging the field -> one of these is Binary Ninja -- Binary Ninja is powerful, but it's inherently a static analysis tool -- I missed the dynamic (debugger) integration that IDA had, so I set out to recreate it - plugin introduction (3min) -- Binary Ninja plugin that syncs a running debugger (WinDbg) to Binary Ninja -- combines all the static analysis niceness of Binja with the power of dynamic analysis (WinDbg) -- this has been done before, but it was not done with Windows in mind -- because I primarily reverse games, I wanted to create an easy-to-use Windows solution - primary features (5min) -- launch debugging sessions directly from Binja -- syncs Binja disassembly graph with IP in WinDbg -- set breakpoints and move IP on the diassembly graph in Binja -- highlights branch decisions (know where jumps are going) -- resolve vtable calls and determine object types - live demo (2min) - future work and lessons learned (3min) - questions (2min)  (no supporting files yet but code is still in beta testing and will be released ~1 week before the talk)		No	20 Minute		APPROVED	Track 3	1430	yes
3/12/2018 2:37:48	michael@mwe.st	Michael West	Presentation	Sentry or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Delete My Accounts	With social media, anyone can become "incidentally infamous" in minutes. Your tweet could go viral, your gif could get posted by a president, or the media could single you out because they think you made Bitcoin. This happens to hackers too, @MalwareTechBlog was arrested after DEF CON 2017 and certain media started doxing him and painting him as a spendthrift criminal based on his Twitter posts. Rather than become a social media hermit to prevent this, just set up a Sentry. This talk will present Sentry, an automated cross-platform application that will silently watch your social media for trigger words and unusual behaviors before springing into action. In minutes Sentry can lock your Twitter account, delete your Reddit comments, disable your websites, and a whole host of other actions to keep attention away in high visibility, low-privacy situations. Released under the MIT license and easily extensible, virtually any site and any API can be scripted with a bit of C#.	Michael West, aka T3h Ub3r K1tten, is a Technical Advisor at CyberArk who likes cats and is addicted to Twitter. His homelab has over 640 kilobytes of RAM. Michael presents regularly at Dallas Hackers Association and enjoys combining his software dev background with infosec to build tools for others. His interests include OSINT, amateur radio, and scanning long barcodes on the beach.	Nope!	Since the social media age began, there have been concerns about public posts coming back to harm one's career, public image, and more. Normal people post their day to day life on social media, but under a microscope even the most benign posts can appear malicious or uncouth when taken out of context. This talk provides ample examples of situations where this has occurred, with an emphasis on the implications to hackers.  The suggestion about how to protect one's social media/websites/forum posts/anything public has always been two options: don't post something, or post it privately/anonymously. This talk presents a third option: post the public things, but keep an automated finger on the trigger to hide or delete your posts and accounts. With a simple JSON file, you can configure this behavior both manually and automatically - say, lock your Twitter account if any of your posts gets over 1,000 retweets, or when you post "pineapple" to Facebook.  The title is a play on the classic 1964 movie Dr. Strangelove where a Soviet "dead man's switch" threatens to trigger a doomsday scenario. Throughout the talk I poke fun that the code, while designed to be failsafe, could accidentally delete all your accounts if configured wrong or triggered prematurely. This is partially for fun, and also to remind attendees of the need to be careful during implementation. If there are space requirements or it just doesn't "fit" with other talks, the title can absolutely be changed! 	https://drive.google.com/open?id=1I7iWpodoXFdKW4-MsX4PBARdFkSelcHB	No	20 Minute		APPROVED	Track 3	1030	yes
3/12/2018 15:04:05	drew.kirkpatrick@securedecisions.com	Drew Kirkpatrick	Presentation	Open source SAST and DAST tools for web app pen testing	This session will discuss how web application penetration testers can improve their white box testing using two new open source tools, funded by the Department of Homeland Security. The Attack Surface Detector tool performs static code analysis to detect hidden endpoints and parameters and pulls them into Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP attack surface. The second tool, OWASP Code Pulse, instruments the web application server bytecode to provide real-time code coverage to help identify gaps in testing, help tune and compare testing tools, as well as provide a useful metric for communicating testing activities.	Drew has over fifteen years of experience designing and building complex systems including application security tools, network management, cyber curriculum development, and transit and aerospace systems. He works to improve information security and software assurance by applying computer science, ethical hacking, and human factors knowledge to build novel systems to meet complex needs. Before joining Secure Decisions as a Security Researcher, Drew was a Senior Computer Scientist in the U.S. Navy Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Laboratory. He is a certified GWAPT and OSCP, and a member of the GIAC Advisory Board. He received his B.A. in Psychology and Economics from St. Mary’s College of Maryland, and Master’s degrees in Computer Science and Computer Information Systems from Florida Institute of Technology.	Nope. 	White hat penetration testers are generally at a disadvantage compared to the malicious attackers they help defend against. They have limited time and resources to secure the entire application, where attackers have unlimited time and may only need a single vulnerability. This session will discuss how web application penetration testers can improve their white box testing using two new open source tools, funded by the Department of Homeland Security. These tools leverage access to application source code and server bytecode to provide an advantage to the penetration tester working with the development team.   The Attack Surface Detector tool performs static code analysis to first detect the web application endpoints, parameters, and parameter datatypes. This information is then pulled into the Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP web application testing suites to allow for rapid dynamic testing of the discovered attack surface. The benefit of this approach over traditional spidering techniques is that hidden endpoints are found without brute force guessing, and optional parameters not seen in the client-side code are discovered.   The second tool, OWASP Code Pulse, instruments the web application server bytecode to provide real-time code coverage while testing the application. This allows the penetration tester to measure how much of the application server code their testing has touched, and visually displays gaps in their testing coverage. This real-time feedback helps testers tune their testing to maximize the amount of code covered, compare performance of different testing tools and activities, and communicate useful metrics of testing activity to others.  Upcoming features and major releases will be discussed, a brief demonstration of the tools will be given, and a question and answer portion will complete the session.

3/12/2018 16:41:22	64bit.julian@gmail.com	Julian Pileggi	Presentation	Top SIEM Rules You Should Implement Today	Developing and maintaining an effective SIEM often takes a small army, and can be quite vexatious. In this talk, the audience will be presented with a compilation of the best and most effective SIEM use cases. Gone are the days of noisy, false positive prone alerts – this talk is focused on high accuracy use cases only! We will tie these use cases back to activities performed by threat actors and red teams alike. This talk will be of interest to SOC analysts, security engineers and SIEM content developers.	Julian Pileggi is a Principal Incident Response Consultant at Mandiant, based in Toronto, Canada. His areas of expertise include enterprise incident response, digital forensics, threat hunting and security operations center team development. Prior to his employment at Mandiant, Julian worked at a large financial institution as a key member of their SOC team, helping to develop it into an industry leader in Canada.	No	Blue teams struggle with developing effective content for their SIEMs. Based on years of experience developing use cases for large enterprises, tuning them and testing them in actual production environment and through SOC response processes, this material will hit home with the audience.  Every year on the conference circuit I look for something that can help in this space and I have never seen a talk presented that actually has specific content folks can implement at home. Most organizations and professional services team don’t want to share this information, as it is considered protected intellectual property, and that is why I think this is so valuable for the industry. We need to come together to share this kind of information to help raise the bar and ensure we have an effective level of detection throughout North America. I have presented this talk at the largest security conference in Canada, and it was extremely well received. As a sometimes-trainer for Mandiant, I have also given this as an extra lecture to students during our Enterprise Incident Response course and have received accolades consistently on the value of the content.

Our research focuses on determining which features are most relevant in detecting botnet activity and designing a machine learning infrastructure to detect anomalies.  Our talk will provide a high level overview of our system which features a method for dynamically generating profiles about known device traffic and signatures for anomaly detection.	Jonathan Myers is currently pursuing his Bachelors of Science in Computing Security while also working as a Research Assistant at the Rochester Institute of Technology.  His areas of interest include binary exploitation, web application security, and security tool development.  Jonathan is also an active member of the Security Practices and Research Student Association at the Rochester Institute of Technology.   	None	Our talk is focuses on our system’s design for tackling the problem of detecting IoT specific botnet activity.  Our system operates by extracting relevant features from both malicious and benign network traffic with a low powered inline device that is placed between the modem and the devices themselves.  After extraction the features are forwarded to a remote machine learning infrastructure.  Here we test several models and algorithms to classify the traffic and create device profiles from the normal benign traffic.  From here we generate signatures which are forwarded back to the device.  The device finally uses these signatures to power an on board intrusion detection system and generate metrics for further research. This talk will include a detailed insight into our solution, our process for picking features, and our method for dynamically generating signatures. Additionally we will give a brief overview of machine learning, specifically classification.		No	20 Minute		APPROVED	Track 3	1330	yes

Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) are used to both harden and assess many government information systems. In this presentation, the speaker will demonstrate how the STIGViewer tool is used to apply STIG rules to a Windows 7 laptop. There will also be a brief discussion of why "STIGing" a system is a useful tool for determining the security posture of a system.	Donna Moskowitz Fork is a cybersecurity engineer at General Dynamics Missions Systems (GDMS) in Pittsfield, MA. She obtained her B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) and an M.S. in Cybersecurity from UAH. She has worked for several different government contractors as a software engineer, systems engineer, and most recently as a cybersecurity engineer.	I would like to take a train from Albany to Rochester, so would need to coordinate with the train schedule. Thanks.	Depending on access to the Internet, I will either show screenshots of the DISA STIG site or access the site if Internet is available. This is to acquaint the audience with the hundreds of STIGs available. Next the audience will be shown how to obtain STIGViewer, a tool used to read a STIG and also to create an artifact containing useful information about the security posture of a system. The speaker will bring an old Windows 7 laptop containing a STIG and the STIGViewer and if this can be connected up to a screen, the audience will be able to see in real time how STIGViewer works and how a cybersecurity engineer might assess a system using a STIG. If this is not possible, screenshots will be available in a Powerpoint presentation showing the steps to download a STIG, download STIGViewer, insert the STIG into the Viewer, create a checklist file, fill out the checklist file, save the checklist file, get back into the file using STIGViewer, save the file as an Excel spreadsheet, and discuss some of the columns in the spreadsheet that are useful. The talk will wind up by advising anyone interested in pursuing a cybersecurity career with a government contractor to download a STIG and try use it to assess their own machines. It should be noted that some knowledge of STIGs might be helpful to discuss in a job interview for a cybersecurity position. This addresses the second part of the presentation, i.e., why should the audience care about STIGs. 		No	20 Minute		APPROVED	Track 3	1500	waiting
